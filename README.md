# Modern React Redux Shop

A modern, responsive e-commerce application built to master **Redux Toolkit** patterns and state management in React. This project simulates a real-world shopping experience with a good UI design.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project was created specifically to learn and implement core Redux patterns commonly used in e-commerce applications. Key concepts explored include:

- **Redux Architecture**: Understanding the flow of data in a global state management system.
- **Slices**: Creating modular state logic using Redux Toolkit's `createSlice`.
- **Async Thunks**: Handling asynchronous logic (like API calls) directly within slices using `createAsyncThunk`.
- **Hooks**: Utilizing `useSelector` to read from state and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.
- **Store Configuration**: Setting up the Redux store and combining multiple reducers.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern UI/UX**: A clean design using Tailwind CSS.
- **Product Grid**: Responsive layout with hover effects and product details.
- **Shopping Cart**: Fully functional cart with add, remove, and quantity adjustment features.
- **State Persistence**: Cart data persists via local storage (if implemented) or Redux state.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React 19**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Standard way to write Redux logic.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing for better code quality and developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling.
